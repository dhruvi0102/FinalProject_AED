Emergency system: (Home and Beyond)
We have designed this system so that anyone can use it in the event of an emergency. Although we do have specific phone numbers for each type of emergency in the current world, but we have considered what would happen in the event of an emergency in which more than one type of assistance was required at the same time. People in these situations have the option of using our system or getting in touch with the admin to generate the request.

Design:
•	J Swing: we have used J swing for the UI of the application in which we have used card layout and different components like button, text box, labels, table, password field.
•	Email: we have used email as extra function for this project where an email is sent to the person for whom the request is generated.
•	Database: We have used db4o as a database for this project.

Roles:
1.	System Admin: System admins can create admins for existing organizations in the system, conduct CRUD operations on them, and create new emergency requests or manage existing ones.
2.	Request Admin: this user can manage and create request
3.	User: A user is a regular individual who can register, generate a request, and select specific emergency services from the system.
4.	Area Admin: The area admin has the ability to create a new area, including with a name and the area's zip code.
5.	Fire services admin: Fire service admin can review requests for his station and then allocate units that are either factory fire or housing fire based on the situation.
6.	Police services admin: This user decides which traffic unit or control unit to assign for the request
7.	Hospital Services admin: this user will we decide which doctor or ambulance to send for the request
8.	Shelter services admin: this will decide which shelter to assign the request.
